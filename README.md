## Gatsby Essentials Blog

This project was inspired/started by the [Gatsby Starter Blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) project. There's a lot of tutorials available for getting started with that project. However, you'll quickly realize that it doesn't fit the needs of most blogs. That's where this project comes in. We've added several features you'll want in your own blog right away. From starter to essentials.
