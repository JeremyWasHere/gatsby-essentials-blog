## Gatsby Essentials Blog

This project was inspired/started by the [Gatsby Starter Blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) project. There's a lot of tutorials available for getting started with that project. However, you'll quickly realize that it doesn't fit the needs of most blogs. That's where this project comes in. We've added several features you'll want in your own blog right away. From starter to essentials.

### Additional features beyond Gatsby Starter Blog

- Index / Home page - Starter has nothing but a list of blog posts, this has been moved to /blog/
- Content pages - Even a personal blog is going to have a stand alone About Me page that isn't cycled through with blog posts.
- Thumbnail images - Added to the list of blog posts but also included in the Twitter/Facebook metatags.
- Pagination - You're going to write a lot of posts. You don't want the list to grow forever!
- Read more cards - If a visitor reads your post, why not suggest more for them?
- Site map - Essential for Google Search Console and SEO.

Adding some additional essential features soon.
